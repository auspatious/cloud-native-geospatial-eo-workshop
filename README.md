# Cloud Native Geospatial for Earth Observation Workshop

This repository contains workshop materials to that introduce
cloud native methods of working with Earth observation data products.

There are two activities, each with an annotated notebook:

- Activity 1: Find, Load, Visualise
- Activity 2: Cloud Native Land Productivity for SDG 15

Activity 1 demonstrates how to query the Digital Earth Australia STAC 
catalog and produce a visually appealing image for a location in Australia. 

Activity 2 demonstrates how to measure land productivity
as a subindicator of Sustainable Development Goal indicator 15.3.1:
Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area. For more information
please see the
[Satellite Data Requirements for SDGIndicator 15.3.1](https://ceos.org/sdg/files/supportsheets/SDG_15.3.1_EO_Satellite_Data_Requirements_31Aug2022.pdf)
document.
The use case covers an area of agriculture and forest on the Ba River in Fiji. 

## Quickstart

### Tutorial PDF

Along with a completed notebook, we provide a [step-by-step PDF document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1phRVjQPga80dylDcYZvL0UqGnWyIxENA/view?usp=sharing).
This was used to run the tutorial at the 2024 AEO Forum.

### Start the Codespace

The easiest way to get started running through this workshop is to
launch a GitHub Codespace, which includes a VS Code web environment that
includes the ability to run and edit Jupyter Notebooks.

1. Click the green Code button
2. Click the Codespaces tab
3. Click Create codespace on main

### Sign into NASA's Earthdata portal and create an access token

Sign up for EarthData: [https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/) if you don't have an account already.

The notebook uses the [`earthaccess`](https://github.com/nsidc/earthaccess) library for authenticating with NASA's Earthdata system.

`earthaccess.login()` prompts you for your Earthdata username and password. Once authenticated, you will have access to credentials for both HTTP and S3 access to Earthdata collections.

### Run the demonstration notebooks

Open the `Find_Load_Visualise.ipynb`
notebook and work through the cells.

Open the `Cloud_Native_Land_Productivity_For_SDG15.ipynb`
notebook and work through the cells.

## Authorship and sponsorship

These notebooks were written by Alex Leith and Caitlin Adams, with
financial support from the
[Committee on Earth Observation Satellites](https://ceos.org/)
and advice from members of the [GEO Land Degradation Neutrality Flagship](https://geo-ldn.org/).
The notebooks were reviewed by Lavender Liu and Matthew Ellis.
